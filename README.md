Investigation of different algebras of numbers

1. Do you know what is a linear combination of two complex numbers when coefficients of combinations are also complex?
It appears to be rotation in 2D.

2. Do you know that for 2D plane it is enough to have only three imaginary units instead of four that we have in complex numbers?
The coordinate axes in this case will be three rays on 120 deg each. In complex plane we draw a circle as Exp[i*t] and it has a period 2*Pi. 
In threepolar plane I draw a circle as Exp[i*t] and it has a different period. Guess the number.

3. Do you know how to work in 3D having only 1, i, j, k and no minuses? I use four rays from one center in 3D (by analogy with 3 rays in 2D).
Do you know what will be the sphere representation here? Maybe Exp[i*u+j*v]?

These are the points of my research in this project.
