Investigation of different algebras of numbers

1. Do you know what is a linear combination of two complex numbers when coefficients of combinations are also complex?
It appears to be rotation in 2D.

2. Do you know that for 2D plane it is enough to have only three imaginary units instead of four that we have in complex numbers?
The coordinate axes in this case will be three rays on 120 deg each. In complex plane we draw a circle as Exp[i*t] and it has a period 2*Pi. 
In threepolar plane I draw a circle as Exp[i*t] and it has a different period. Guess the number.

3. Do you know how to work in 3D having only 1, i, j, k and no minuses? I use four rays from one center in 3D (by analogy with 3 rays in 2D).
Do you know what will be the sphere representation here? Maybe Exp[i*u+j*v]?

4. It is easy to compute a mean value of scalar values, or points in 2D, or in 3D. It is often used for data normalization, or as a reference value to compare to. There are several types of means: arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, etc. These are different and suitable for different things. For an example read about geometric mean on wiki. What I would like to do is to compute things like geometric mean of points in 2D/3D. It is not possible using vectors but when you have 3D points as numbers with all algebraic operations defined then... When you have a curve in 2D and you want to compute dispersion (or higher moments) of its shape you have an option to do it separately for each projection but that is awfull. It is not rotation invariant and thus  does not characterize the curve itself. Totally different story is when you compute dispersion in terms of complex numbers. We get a new tool, a new mean, central, averaged, points that were not possible to find in terms of real algebra. You know the importance of "center of mass", "center of moments", "center of inertia", "center of velocities", "center of acceleration" in mechanics, right? You can get tones of new unexplored "centers" for object recognition/identification methods, and so on and on...


These are the points of my research in this project.
